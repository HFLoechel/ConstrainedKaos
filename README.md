# Fractal Construction of Constrained DNA Codewords

This repository is the official implementation of Fractal Construction of Constrained DNA Codewords.
An implementation of the equations can be found in the R-Script. The optimized algorithms adhere to DNA storage constrains can be found in the Java implementation, within a compiled version: ConstrainedKaos.jar .

## Requirements

### R Script

R version 3.5.3 or higher
R-packages: kaos, viridis, ggplot2, reshape2


### Java Sourcecode

Java 12.0.1
dependencies: Apache Commons Math 3.6.1, JFreeChart 1.0.19, Common 1.0.23

### JAR (ConstrainedKaos.jar)

Java 12.0.1 or higher

## Usage

### R Script

The R Script contains functions for the implementation of the equations adhere to the homopolymer/motif constrain, the GC content/ Hamming distance calculation and the Hamming distance calculation for one codeword against the others. For evrey equation at least one example is provided.
